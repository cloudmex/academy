### Do the React Tutorial (Tic Tac Toe)

Complete the Reactjs.org tutorial for React. [Here the link](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

## Second step - Read

Coding is a lecture work, you have to be clear of know what is happening in your code and there is no simpler way than reading.

Here are examples of React web applications, read them all **at least 5 times** for ensuring you know what is happening.

Ask yourself following questions while reading:

* What is this code doing?
* How is this file interacting with other files?
* How is data flowing through the app?
* How can I storage information?
* How is DOM working?
* Which externals packages are required?
* Which versions of react are being used?
* How components are interacting?
* How states and hooks are interacting?

Here is the list of apps for reading:

* [Calculator](https://github.com/ahfarmer/calculator)
* [Emoji Search](https://github.com/ahfarmer/emoji-search)
* [Snap Shot](https://github.com/Yog9/SnapShot)
* [BMI Calculator](https://github.com/GermaVinsmoke/bmi-calculator)
* [React Image Compressor](https://github.com/Rahul-Pandey7/react-image-compressor)
* [Counter App](https://github.com/arnab-datta/counter-app)

## Third step - Define final project idea

Is not required to tell us now what project you will present in final **Demo Day**, but start thinking about it, you can look at Day 0 about what is required for this demo.

Once you have your final project defined, you can tell us via Discord Server of CloudMex Academy.

## Four step - Full course MERN

As if previous steps were not enough, we ask you to complete more as possible of **MERN Stack course**, is not required to complete it today, but try your harder for covering topics during the rest of WFD.
